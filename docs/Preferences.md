# Preferences

ULOSINO gives you the power to change how the app looks and behaves.

Most preferences are stored by your browser on your computerÂ so that they stay the same each time you use ULOSINO.

## Change Preferences

To change your preferences, open Preferences:

- On desktop, select the gear button on the right side of the navigation bar.
- On mobile, select Menu and then Preferences.

Preferences are grouped into Appearance, Notifications, and Advanced groups. Appearance and Notification preferences change how ULOSINO looks and feels, while Advanced preferences change advanced application settings and behaviours.

- On desktop, use the sidebar to toggle each group and reveal different options.
- On mobile, select a group from the list to reveal the options in that group.

## Restore the Default Preferences

It's possible to restore the default preferences of ULOSINO.

To restore your preferences to the defaults, open Preferences, select Advanced and then Use Default Preferences.

> If the Use Default Preferences button is disabled, you're already using the default preferences.

## Transfer Preferences

Let's say you've really customised The Friendly Flow. Now you're using another browser and you don't know how to apply the preferences you're used to!

Don't worry. Preferences are mapped to Preference Codes and you can enter your Preference Code on another browser or device to apply the same preferences.

To do this:

1. Open Preferences, select Advanced and then Open Preference Transfer (Beta) on the source browser.
2. Copy the Current Preference Code for the source browser.
3. Repeat step 1 on the target browser.
4. Enter the code from step 2. on the target browser.
