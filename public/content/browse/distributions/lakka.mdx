[Lakka](https://lakka.tv) is a Linux distribution descending from LibreELEC that "transforms a ... computer into a ... retrogaming console." It targets the gaming market. Lakka is the flagship of the RetroArch ecosystem - the frontend - and implements `libretro` to play emulated ROMs on an x86 or arm based system. The OS supports networking and multiplayer gameplay, and broad customisation of the system behaviors. Lakka uses the RetroArch GUI, which is based off the PlayStation 3 XMB interface. Additionally, one can access the command line through SSH and host media servers.
