# Contribute to ULOSINO

Unlike other platforms, there is no need to wait many months or spend many hundreds of dollars (perhaps in a foreign currency) to get projects an instant presence on ULOSINO. Instead, submitting distributions on ULOSINO is based on community forks and pull requests; distribution pages are created by contributors and powered by the Markdown format. This allows for easy creation of distribution pages, rather than having learning multiple programming languages ([about Markdown on ULOSINO...](/search/demo)).

As you'll be working with forking and pull requests, **you'll need a GitHub account to continue.**

To contribute:

1. Fork the existing ULOSINO code base, [available on GitHub...](/toimplement).
2. Download the files as a compressed zip file.
3. Copy a contribution template (located at the root of the directory) to the /public/distributions folder.
4. Change the name of the file to the distribution you wish to write on.
5. Edit the metadata and body of the template to match the distribution you're writing on.
6. Commit your changes.
7. Create a pull request to have you changes integrated into ULOSINO. Make it clear if work impacts your submission; e.g. if you personally contribute to the distribution.

You can also refer to the [GitHub Forking Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for further information.

Also, please note some general submission criteria:

- Distributions which use embedded advertising or an 'open-core'/'freemium' model aren't permitted.
- 'Flavours' are considered different distributions. For example 'Blueberry Desktop' and 'Blueberry Server' would have different pages.
- Distributions should be tagged if they have different versions available. For example, if a 'beta' version is available, then the distribution's page version string would be '1.0.0, 1.0.0-beta'.
- To ensure consistency, we prefer you write in Commonwealth (British) English and minimise usage of styled (bold, italic, etc) text. Write respectfully.
- ULOSINO reserves the right to deny submissions.
